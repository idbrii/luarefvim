luarefvim contains two Vim help files:

* The reference manual for [Lua 5.1](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html) (with minor exceptions and adaptations)
* The love2d API docs generated by [vim-love-docs](https://github.com/davisdude/vim-love-docs)

Since these manuals are converted from their source form into vim help files,
you can search them using `:help`, `:helpgrep`, etc.

# Recommended usage:

Install [vim-lua-ftplugin](https://github.com/idbrii/vim-lua-ftplugin) and set:

```vim
let loaded_luarefvim = 0
```

[vim-lua-ftplugin](https://github.com/idbrii/vim-lua-ftplugin) implements
`xolox#lua#help()` and binds it to `K` which provides a superior documentation
lookup solution to what's implemented here.
